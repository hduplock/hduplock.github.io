        <h2>Lila</h2>
        <p>Lila was our third dog, a Cairn Terrier. We adopted her in 2011, just a few weeks shy of her seventh birthday. We actually were never told her real birthday, as both her previous owners had passed, but we knew it was in late March, early April, so we celebrated on April 4th. She was a sassy dog, always barking up a storm or making other weird noises, but she was amazing. She loved to play with our big dogs and loved to be with her humans. She sadly passed away earlier this year on February 27th, just a few weeks shy of her 18th birthday.</p>

        <p>Here is a list of some short stories, in no particular order, that show her personality.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We once found henry walking around with Lila hanging from his ear</li>
          <li>She would also give non-stop kisses, like they never ended</li>
          <li>When I came home from school she would jump on the couch for snuglles imediately</li>
          <li>Would escape and take herself on walks and always return</li>
          <li>Once climbed inside the dishwasher to help clean</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And now here are some weird behaviors and facts about the myth that is Lila.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Came to us desf but re-gained her hearing</li>
          <li>Went blind but also got that back</li>
          <li>Was mauled by a cayote at 13, died on the vet table and still survived to tell the tale</li>
          <li>Was old enough to get her lisence</li>
          <li>Believed she was the boss of everything</li>
          <li>Terrible breath</li>
          <li>Would always rolld over begging for belly rubs</li>
          <li>Was blind and deaf for her final two years but you could barely tell</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Lila was always an old sould, but that comes with being born in 2004. She was also resiliant and taught me true strength and percervierence. She might have been an annoying little rat sometimes, but she was my annoying little rat. She was always there when I needed a snuggle or some entertainment. She was here to guide George and Henry into the afterlife and was here to guide Cooper and Ollie as they entered our family. For a dog so small, she truly has left a massive hole in our household</p>
