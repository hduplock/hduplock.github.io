        <p>Cooper is our fourth dog and current leader of the pack. He was born on August 27, 2015 as a stray in South Carolina. He was rescued and after he was rehabilitated and fostered, we adopted him in January of 2017. He is a boxer/bull mastiff mix but embodies the heart and soul of Henry. Cooper is our most protective dog, always making sure we're safe and happy. He's also a massive goofball.</p>

        <p>Here is a list of some short stories, in no particular order, that show his personality.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If you sit on the ground he will sit on top of you</li>
          <li>He loves leaning on you if he loves you</li>
          <li>His leash broke halfway through a walk but he stayed next to us the whole time</li>
          <li>Destroyed an indestructible chew toy in 5 minutes</li>
          <li>Tour his ACL but didn't limp or whine until six months after it happened</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And now here are some weird behaviors and facts about the beast that is Cooper.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>is 140 lbs</li>
          <li>Has a sixth sense for cheese</li>
          <li>Slobbers a lot</li>
          <li>Was best friends with and played a lot with our old bunny</li>
          <li>Lets kids do whatever they want to him</li>
          <li>Believes he is a lap dog</li>
          <li>He never met our older brother and when he visited, thought he was an intruder and scared him off</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Cooper is the current guardian of the Duplock household. He may be a massive dog that will put his life on the line to save ours, but he's still a massive goofball. He is our vets favorite dog and everyone that meets him falls instantly in love. He is 140 lbs of pure joy</p>

        <h2>About his breeds</h2>

        <div class="box">
          <figure>
            <img src="images/cooperone.jpg" alt="A bullmastiff enjoying a cool breeze">

        </div>

        <p>Cooper is a mix of both a boxer and bullmastiff so there's no real specifics on his breed. But based on our time with him and information about the other breeds, here are some personality traits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Bright</li>
          <li>Friendly</li>
          <li>Devoted</li>
          <li>Intelligent</li>
          <li>Protective</li>
          <li>Powerful</li>
          <li>Loving</li>
          <li>Reliable</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here is some basic information about the breeds:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Boxer's life span is 8-12 years</li>
          <li>Bullmastiff's life span is 8-10 years</li>
          <li>Bullmastiffs can be 24-27 inches tall (when on all fours and measured from paw to shoulder)</li>
          <li>Boxers can be 21-25 inches tall (when on all fours and measured from paw to shoulder)</li>
          <li>Bullmastiffs can weigh 110-130 lbs on average</li>
          <li>Boxers can weigh 55-70 lbs on average</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As with most big dogs, here are some health problems you can expect:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hip dysplasia</li>
          <li>Ear infections</li>
          <li>Cancer</li>
          <li>Arthritis</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall Cooper is a mutt so what I say here may not be the same with another dog of his kind. These are just the experiences we had with him and some basic knowledge of the breeds that make up Cooper.</p>
