        <p>Ollie is our fifth and most recent edition to the pack. He was born on March 13, 2018 and just recently turned four years old. He is a Havanese which is another small dog breed. But don't let his size fool you as he is quite bold and bosses our mastiff around</p>

        <p>Here is a list of some short stories, in no particular order, that show his personality.</p>

<h5>Laguages</h5><p>list</p>



        <ul>
          <li>His favorite way of playing is by either using your hand as a chew or trying to bite your neck</li>
          <li>He loves belly rubs even if he doesn't want anyone to know that</li>
          <li>On his first birthday he escaped and we chased him for three miles before finally getting him</li>
          <li>If he wants to be let out or wants anything he will only go to my door and ask me for help</li>
          <li>Once stole a pair of my shoes and I have not seen them since/li>
        </ul>

        <p>And now here are some weird behaviors and facts about the rascal that is Ollie.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>He is 14 lbs</li>
          <li>Knows the moment you wake up because he will be at your door</li>
          <li>Is the fastest animal in history (not fact checked)</li>
          <li>Believes he is a guard dog but will only go outside with Cooper</li>
          <li>Used to bring live frogs inside as gifts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ollie is the life and soul of our household. He demands to be the center of attention and the star of the show. At the end of the day however, he is my best friend and is constantly by my side when I'm home. He sleeps in my bed and will wait for me to wakeup before he moves. You can see the pure trust and love he has for us in his eyes and he truly is the sweetest little boy</p>
