    <h1>About Harvey</h1>

    <h2>Growing up</h2>
    <p>I was born on a brisk November day in 2002, the first day of November to be exact.
    It was quite the occasion as I was the last born in the Duplock family, well
    by only two and three minutes as I'm a triplet. Along with my triplet sisters
    I also have two older brothers so it was quite the household growing up, especially with our many pets.
    Actually, I've had so many pets, I might as well show a table of all the pets I've had.</p>

    <p>In 2007 our family made the journey over the Atlantic Ocean and moved to America, where I grew up.
    I live in a small Connecticut town where being bored was the most exciting part. I had an average
    childhood playing video games, and spending time with my many dogs and other pets. In fact my love
    for animals had me dreaming of being a vet, but that changed when I built my first computer as I then
    wanted to be a computer programmer. That also changed when I started high school. I was always told I had
    a natural ability to present and orate, so I decided to join the TV Broadcasting department, and the rest is history.
    And when I say rest I mean I fell in love with it, ended up being pretty good at it, then fell in love with UM, came here
    and am now a Broadcast Journalism major.</p>

    <h2>TV Broadcasting Career</h2>
    <p>When I first joined the TV program at the high school, it was just an intro course but, it grabbed my attention.
    For some reasos it just clicked with my mind and not only could I do it well but I loved it. This led to me
    trying out for our school's weatherman position and, I got it. That position caused a domino effect as I
    quickly rose through the ranks. Just six weeks later I was main anchor, the first ever Main Anchor as a junior
    in NCTV history. I also quickly became an assoicate producer, then very quickly an executive producer which led
    to me becoming station manager. Then I went to college where I luckily found the same success. As a freshman I was cast
    on two shows, NewsBreak and our comedy show Off the Wire. Now as a sophomore I'm the AP for Off the Wire and NewsVision
    as well as the head writer and editor for Off the Wire's This is the News(our version of weekend update).
    I have learned a lot throughout my time and some of my skills include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Photoshop</li>
      <li>Adobe Premiere</li>
      <li>Final Cut Pro</li>
      <li>Script writing</li>
      <li>Producing</li>
      <li>TriCaster</li>
      <li>Teleprompter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Goals</h2>

    <p>I've got a lot of goals, some of them realistic, some of them not. But first, I want to create a platform to post
    sketch comedy on with my friends, so we can create our own content without having to follow all OTW rules. A second goal is
    to write a show with them and sell it. Then I would like to be cast in that show or any other show. I would love
    to be in a movie and then finally start my own production company.</p>
