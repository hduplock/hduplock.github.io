        <p>George was born on July 1, 2008 up north in Canada. He came into my life a couple of month later, when I was just starting kindergarten. He was a gentle soul his entire life, he couldn't even hurt a fly. George was never the brightest dog, in fact he was quite dumb, but all that lack of knowledge left a lot of room for a lot of love. He was with us for 11 years, and even then it felt too short. He passed away on December 9, 2019.</p>

        <p>Here is a list of some short stories, in no particular order, that show his personality.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>He never played with toys, just wanted to be with his humans</li>
          <li>If you went in for a cuddle, he'd go for a kiss, and wouldn't stop kissing you</li>
          <li>He had seperation anxiety, which Henry later helped him with</li>
          <li>Refused to go on walks without Henry</li>
          <li>In his later years when he was less moobile, he would howl from the doorstep when we came home</li>
          <li>Only ever wanted to be with one of us, and would bark if he wasn't</li>
          <li>If you stopped petting him, he'd punch you in the face</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And now here are some weird behaviors and facts about the legend that is George.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>He was a big dog, weighing in at around 110 lbs</li>
          <li>He was terrified of stairs, until he was nine years old, then he decided he would use stairs</li>
          <li>He was terrible at using stairs so I always had to carry him instead</li>
          <li>Would sleep outside for months at a time because he wanted to</li>
          <li>Even when old he would always try to get up, just so he could walk in between your legs</li>
          <li>Beleieved he was a lap dog</li>
          <li>Could not catch anything in his mouth</li>
          <li>Was a very good boy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>George will be remebered for his massive heart and goofy personality and for being there for us when we needed him most. He truly was one of the greatest dogs anyone would ever meet.</p>

        <h3>About Henry</h3>

        <p>Henry was born on November 1, 2008 also in Canada, he was Georges biological cousin. Henry also shared the same birthday as me and my sisters, which was amazing. We got him after George suffered a brain infection, which left him dumb, and also because if we didn't get him, he would've been sent to the pound as no one wanted him due to his unique white marking on his face. Henry was the smartest dog I've ever had, but he was also the most compassionate and loving, somehow even more than George. Henry was a warrior, beating leptospirosis, arm cancer, and mouth cancer before circuming to a rare stomach cancer that had never been seen in a dog before. He passed away on October 6, 2015, just three weeks shy of his seventh birthday.</p>

        <p>And now for some short stories that show Henry's personality</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Whenever we came home, he would run outside and make sure veryone was home, and safe inside before going back inside.</li>
          <li>Was not scared of stairs so he followed us everywhere</li>
          <li>Loved sleeping in the bathroom because it was cold</li>
          <li>Refused to go on walks without George</li>
          <li>Loved to play with our 12lb terrier</li>
          <li>Was friends with, and played with a coyote</li>
          <li>Also friends with a deer</li>
          <li>Tried to be friends with a snapping turtle, got bit, did not care at all</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And now here are some weird behaviors and facts about the icon that is Henry.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>He was a big dog, weighing in at around 120 lbs, bigger than George</li>
          <li>Would also run in between any legs he saw</li>
          <li>Loved to jump up only when he wanted a hug</li>
          <li>Was genuinely the happiest soul in the world</li>
          <li>Also believed he was a lap dog</li>
          <li>Professional fly eater</li>
          <li>Would let little children ride him like a horse</li>
          <li>Was the greatest boy to ever live</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Henry will be remembered for his intelligence and ability to love and teach others how to love. I learned how to be a human because of this dog. He also saved George and was the motivation he needed to keep going every day. Henry also had the greatest smile of any living being, and that's just a fact.</p>
